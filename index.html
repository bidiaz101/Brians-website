            I was working in the healthcare field, then switched to the lab, 
            but now I am excited to start coding. 
            My first independent project is building this website!

            That's me! I've kept a pretty low profile online so there aren't a
            ton of recent pics I have of myself. But what I do have are pics of dogs!

            Those are our dogs! Two of them at least. Their names are Napoleon
            and Macchiato. I have a lot of silly names for them, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Poocherinos</li>
                <li>Doo-doo heads</li>
                <li>Chubbsters</li>
            </ul>
